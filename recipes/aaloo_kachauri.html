    <p>Aaloo Kachauri is a popular Indian snack, particularly enjoyed in North India. It consists of a deep-fried, flaky pastry filled with a spiced potato mixture. The filling typically includes mashed potatoes, cumin, coriander, and green chilies, giving it a savory and slightly tangy flavor. Kachauris are often served with tamarind chutney or yogurt and are a favorite during festivals and special occasions. Theyâ€™re loved for their crispy exterior and flavorful filling, making them a delicious treat for any time of day!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul><li><strong>For the Dough :- </strong>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida), 2 tablespoons oil or ghee, 1/4 teaspoon salt, Water (as needed)</li>
    <li><strong>For the Filling :- </strong>2-3 boiled potatoes (mashed), 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera), 1 green chili (finely chopped), 1 teaspoon ginger (grated), 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder, 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder), Salt (to taste), Fresh coriander leaves (finely chopped, optional)</li>
    <li><strong>For Frying :- </strong>Oil for deep frying.</li></ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol><li><strong>Prepare the Dough :- </strong>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and oil or ghee. Mix well.
        Gradually add water to form a smooth, pliable dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Filling :- </strong>In a bowl, mix the boiled and mashed potatoes with cumin seeds, coriander powder, garam masala, green chilies, ginger, and salt. You can also add chopped coriander if desired.
        Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Kachauris :- </strong>Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball).
        Take one ball, flatten it slightly, and place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center.
        Carefully bring the edges together to seal the filling, then flatten it gently into a disc, being careful not to let the filling escape.</li>
    <li><strong>Fry the Kachauris :- </strong>Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat.
        Once the oil is hot, gently slide the kachauris into the oil, a few at a time, depending on the size of your pan.
        Fry until they puff up and turn golden brown, turning occasionally for even cooking.
        Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve :- </strong>Serve hot with tamarind chutney or yogurt.</li></ol>
