    <p>Mawe ke Ladoo are traditional Indian sweets made primarily from mawa (khoya), which is reduced milk. These delicious round balls are typically flavored with cardamom and often contain nuts like almonds or cashews. The preparation involves cooking the mawa until it thickens, then mixing in sugar and nuts before shaping the mixture into ladoos. They are rich, indulgent, and popular during festivals and celebrations, offering a delightful balance of sweetness and nutty flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul><li><strong>Mawa (khoya) :- </strong>250 grams</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar (powdered) :- </strong>100 grams (adjust as per taste)</li>
    <li><strong>Ghee (clarified butter) :- </strong>1 to 2 tablespoon</li>
    <li><strong>Cardamom powder :- </strong>1/2 teaspoon</li>
    <li><strong>Chopped dry fruits (like almonds, pistachios, and cashews) :- </strong>2 to 3 tablespoon</li>
    <li><strong>Desiccated coconut (optional, for coating) :- </strong></li>2 to 3 tablespoons</ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol><li><strong>Prepare the mawa :- </strong>In a non-stick pan, heat the ghee over low to medium heat.
        Add the mawa and cook, stirring continuously, until it turns slightly golden and gives off a rich aroma (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Ingredients :- </strong>Once the mawa is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add the powdered sugar. Mix well until the sugar melts and combines with the mawa.
        Add the cardamom powder, chopped nuts, and saffron (if using). Stir until everything is evenly mixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool the mixture :- </strong>Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool slightly until itâ€™s comfortable to handle but still warm.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the ladoo :- </strong>Grease your palms with a little ghee. Take small portions of the mixture and roll them into round balls (ladoo).</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Set :- </strong>Place the ladoos on a plate and let them cool completely. They will firm up as they cool.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve :- </strong>Enjoy the Mawe Ke Ladoo as a sweet treat or during festivals!</li></ol>
